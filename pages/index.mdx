Hey, I am Souvik Das @[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/souvik-das-b8115916b/)

A Software Engineer with 1+ year of experience, I excel in monitoring, managing, and debugging workflows using tools like Arena and Airflow, with a focus on achieving a 99% success rate. I have hands-on experience in data processing from Data Warehouses and Data Lakes, particularly in Snowflake and Arena. I'm proficient in debugging and reviewing error logs, ensuring seamless workflow execution.

During my tenure at Globallogic India Pvt. Ltd., I expanded my knowledge of C/C++ fundamentals and gained experience in debugging and reviewing code, using GDB to identify and resolve issues.

My coding profiles on platforms like GeeksforGeeks, Codeforces, and LeetCode reflect my passion for coding and problem-solving. I have a strong command of various programming languages, including C/C++, JavaScript, Python, and Java, and I am well-versed in HTML, CSS, and UI frameworks like ReactJS, Bootstrap, and Material UI.

I am enthusiastic, ambitious, and always ready to embrace new challenges in a work-driven culture. I'm excited about the future of technology and look forward to contributing my skills to innovative projects and collaborating with like-minded professionals.

Let's connect and explore opportunities to work together!
